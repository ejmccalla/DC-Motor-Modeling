This project contains the source needed to model the open-loop dynamics and
steady-state of a brushed DC motor.

The State_Space_Model_Inputs.py file is where the user can make changes to
the inputs of the model.

The State_Space_Model.py file uses the model inputs and generates
the outputs of the model.
